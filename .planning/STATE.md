## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Detection and performance requirements grouped into Phase 1 (must validate stability before scoring depends on it)
- [Roadmap]: Multiplayer deferred to v2 (solo demo is the priority for hackathon)
- [Roadmap]: UI requirements distributed across feature phases rather than a separate UI phase

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Hackathon timeline is days/weeks -- ruthless prioritization required
- Human.js performance on actual demo hardware is unknown (must benchmark in Phase 1)
