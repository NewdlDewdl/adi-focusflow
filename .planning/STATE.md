# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-07)

**Core value:** Users must receive accurate, real-time awareness of when they're losing focus through webcam-based detection
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Webcam Detection Pipeline

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Webcam Detection Pipeline)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-07 -- Completed 01-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 6 min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Webcam Detection Pipeline | 1/3 | 6 min | 6 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 6min
- Trend: First plan

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Detection and performance requirements grouped into Phase 1 (must validate stability before scoring depends on it)
- [Roadmap]: Multiplayer deferred to v2 (solo demo is the priority for hackathon)
- [Roadmap]: UI requirements distributed across feature phases rather than a separate UI phase
- [01-01]: Used ClientDetectionLoader wrapper for next/dynamic ssr:false (Next.js 15 requires ssr:false inside use client components)
- [01-01]: PermissionGate receives state as props instead of owning its own hook (prevents dual state machines)
- [01-01]: HumanGL backend configured per research (3.6x faster warmup than webgl)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Hackathon timeline is days/weeks -- ruthless prioritization required
- Human.js performance on actual demo hardware is unknown (must benchmark in Phase 1)
- Turbopack workspace root warning from lockfile detection; harmless but may surface during development
